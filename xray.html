							<h2>Generating X-Rays!</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>Last updated: 2021-11-13</h3>
						<p>Radiation is pretty neat to me. I've been interested in the topic for a long time and always wanted
						to take x-rays of objects. For years, I have tried generating them using rectifier tubes. At the time,
						however, I used tubes which had leaded-glass and the power supply did not output enough voltage (I'd estimate
						20kV, around 40kV and up is needed to get good x-ray generation).</p>
						<p>Recently, I modified my ZVS flyback driver and experimented with dual-staging flybacks (inspired by 
						<a href="http://uzzors2k.com/index.php?page=tubexray">Uzzors2k</a>).
						This generated very long sparks, indicating I am generating a much higher voltage than previous attempts. Then, I
						connected the new power supply to the rectifier tube I have (Sylvania 6bk4c) and checked if there was any generation of x-rays
						with my geiger counter. To my delight, there was! I had finally generated x-rays. However, there was not enough to make the phosphor screen
						fluoresce. This meant I could not take x-rays of objects.</p>
						<p>After looking through the <a href="https://4hv.org/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?106277">experiments by user radhoo on 4hv forums</a>, I
						sourced two 2X2 tubes and tested them in regular and reverse polarity. Just like radhoo's results, reverse polarity produced more x-rays. This time, the
						x-rays produced caused the phosphor screen to fluoresce, meaning I can now take pictures!. To hold the tubes,I modeled and printed a holder 
						which holds the tubes at a 45 degree angle. This is to follow the results from radhoo's experiments with beam spread.</p>
						<p>When taking pictures, I only run one tube at a time. This is because the crossing beams would result in a blurry image. Running two tubes at
						once is to have fun generating a lot of radiation.</p>
						<p>For radiation shielding, I used a few lead diving weights. This reduced my exposure considerably.</p>
